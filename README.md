![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03cbd841-1bdc-44c2-81fa-794551c1b8ad)

## Overview

NexusMedia is a robust cutting-edge **Backend** project designed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to provide developers and content platforms with a powerful, flexible, and secure infrastructure for building sophisticated digital experiences. It provides a RESTful API for user management, including registration, login, and profile management, along with features such as JWT-based authentication, video and image uploads to Cloudinary, and user subscriptions, likes, playlist and many more similar to **Youtube**.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishnendu-1/NexusMedia_Backend.git
   cd NexusMedia_Backend
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
   CLOUDNARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
   CLOUDNARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDNARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   SECRET_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_secret_key
   PORT=3000

## Usage

  1. To start the server, run:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
The server will be running on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in your .env file).
